    <p>Like many of history's greatest ideas, Tetris came about quite unintentionally in 1984. 
        Alexey Pajitnow was a software engineer at the Soviet Academy of Sciences in Moscow, tasked
        with testing a new type of computer, the Electronika 60. To do so, he wrote a simple game based
        on a puzzle from his childhood. It would help asses how powerful the computer was plus provide a bit 
        of fun. 
        Little did he know that the reulting game would go on to become of the greatest, most addictive and 
        successful of all time.</p>
